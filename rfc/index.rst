   process


Requests for comments (RFCs) defines the high-level decision making process for changes within
the NGFF community. These changes are defined in “Request for Comments”
(RFCs) and therefore this RFC is self-referential: it is following the
process that it itself defines. The overall goal of the process is to make
clear how decision making works with a focus on both speed of development
and clarity. It should be clear after reading the RFC which stakeholder
(author, reviewer, editor, etc.) is responsible for moving decisions along
and how much time the community can expect that decision to take. Not all
decisions in the NGFF community need to follow the RFC process.
Clarifications, corrections, and numerous other changes will proceed
following the current GitHub workflow. However, when decisions reach a
certain scale, including significant specification changes but also changes
to the community process itself, RFCs will provide a mechanism for managing
the process.
